Climate Change refers to **long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns**. These shifts may be natural, like due to volcanic eruptions or solar cycles, but **since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver**, especially due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.
<h2 style="color: orange">Why is Climate Change Important for India?</h2>
India, being a developing and agriculturally dependent country, is **extremely vulnerable to climate risks**.
Examples:
- 2023: **Himachal Pradesh** floods due to excessive monsoon rainfall.
- 2022: **Delhi recorded 49 degree C** - one of its highest ever.
- 2021: Cyclone **Yaas** in the east and Cyclone **Tauktae**  in the west - both linked to warming seas. etc. 
<h2 style="color: orange">Causes of Climate Change</h2>
- **Greenhouse gas emissions** (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O from industries, vehicles, agriculture).
- **Deforestation** (reduces carbon absorption capacity).
- Industrialization & urbanization.
- Over-dependence on coal-based power.
<h2 style="color: orange">Impact of Climate Change</h2>
Climate change isn’t just about heat. Its **impact is multidimensional**:
1. **Agriculture:** Irregular monsoons affect crops like rice and wheat.
2. **Health:** Rise in vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria.
3. **Water crisis:** Glacial melt and irregular rainfall impact rivers and reservoirs.
4. **Economy:** More money spent on disaster relief & infrastructure repair.
<h2 style="color: orange">India’s Steps to Fight Climate Change</h2>
India is actively engaging in **national and international efforts**:
- **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)** – with 8 core missions like Solar Mission, Water Mission etc.
- **International Solar Alliance (ISA)** – launched by India and France.
- **Panchamrit Pledge at COP26 (Glasgow)** – includes net-zero emissions by 2070.
<h2 style="color: orange">International Efforts</h2>
- **Paris Agreement (2015):** Limit global warming to 1.5°C.
- **IPCC Reports:** Warn about rising sea levels, glacier loss, and climate tipping points.
<h2 style="color: orange">What Can We Do?
</h2>
Even as students, small actions matter:
- Use public transport or cycle.
- Reduce single-use plastics.
- Spread awareness

<h2 style="color: Blue">Practice Questions (MCQ Pattern)
</h2>
Q1. What is the primary cause of climate change since the 1800s?
A) Solar flares  
B) Volcanic eruptions  
C) Human activities  
D) Earth’s rotation  
**Answer: C) Human activities**  
**Explain:** Human-induced emissions like CO₂ from fossil fuels have drastically increased atmospheric temperatures.

A) 2030  
B) 2050  
C) 2070  
D) 2100  
**Answer: C) 2070**  
**Explain:** India announced this during the COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow in 2021.

**Q4.** Which Indian initiative focuses on promoting solar energy?  
A) Green India Mission  
B) National Solar Mission  
C) Water Mission  
D) Energy Efficiency Mission  
**Answer: B) National Solar Mission**  
**Explain:** This mission under NAPCC promotes renewable solar energy as a climate solution.

**Q5.** What is the key goal of the Paris Agreement?  
A) Reduce carbon tax  
B) End industrial pollution  
C) Limit global warming  
D) Promote fossil fuel use  
**Answer: C) Limit global warming**  
**Explain:** The agreement aims to restrict global temperature rise to 1.5–2°C above pre-industrial levels.
