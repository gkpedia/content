## Key Points
- **Ganga at Phaphamau rose to 78.40 m, and Chhatnag to 77.68 m; Yamuna at Naini reached 78.30 m**.
- **Around 60% of Sangam riverbank area is submerged**, as water levels climb.
- **Heavy rain upstream in Uttarakhand**, **MP and Rajasthan** driving river swell.
- Low-lying areas like, **Phaphamau, Salori, Daraganj, Jhunsi** are already inundated.
- Authorities have deployed flood chowkis and are monitoring river discharge.
## Introduction
**Heavy rainfall in northern India has caused both Ganga and Yamuna rivers to swell significantly around the Sangam region in Prayagraj**. Water levels climbed steadily at **Phaphamau** and **Chhatnag** on the **Ganga**, while **Yamuna** surged at **Naini**, submerging much of the Sangam riverbank. **Nearly 60% of the area remains underwater due to upstream discharges and continuous rain**. IMD forecasts indicate more rain likely in the coming days. District authorities have set up flood posts and are closely tracing river movements to manage the situation.
## River Levels & Flood Spread
### Rising River Readings
- Ganga at Phaphamau **rose by 8 cm over 24 hours**, reaching **78.40 m**.
- Water level at Chhatnag **increased by 0.26 m, now at 77.68 m**.
- Yamuna surged **by 0.34 m at Naini, reaching 78.30 m**.
- <u>All readings remain below the official danger mark of 84.73 m</u>.
### Submerged Zones
- Flooding reported in **Phaphamau, Salori, Daraganj, and Jhunsi**.
- **Sangam area is approximately 60% underwater**.
- Anticipated further flooding if heavy rain continues.
## Cause & Upstream Factors
### Heavy Rainfall Upstream
- Intense rainfall recorded in **Uttarakhand, MP and Rajasthan**.
- Irrigation officials blame upstream discharge for accelerating flood swell.
### IMD Forecast & Warning
- Continued rains expected over next few days in catchment areas.
- **Authorities issued local alerts** to residents and are maintaining surveillance.
## Administrative Response
### Flood Monitoring
- District has established **flood chowkis in vulnerable zones**.
- Teams are closely monitoring upstream inflows and releasing water as needed.
### Precautionary Measures
- Security personnel placed near ghats and riverbanks.
- **NDRF/SDRF teams** will be deployed if levels near danger mark.
## Conclusion
Persistent heavy rain in northern catchments has <u>pushed Ganga and Yamuna to rising levels in the Sangam region</u>. **With approximately 60% of the riverbank submerged**, the situation requires ongoing monitoring and readiness from authorities. Preparedness measures and flood posts are in place as efforts continue to manage potential flood impacts.
